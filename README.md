# AppliCASion
AppliCASion app made with React Native, Redux, Firebase.

I started this school project to create a mobile application serving as a forum to improve the interconnectedness of SOTA students through networking and supporting one another on topics of art, academics, and life.
SOTA refers to the School of the Arts, Singapore which is my high school.

This is my first experience with building a mobile application. Didn't manage to deploy the app because of lack of time being in an arts school

There are some hacky coding bits in there because of unexpected bugs from ui libraries. The ugliest bits are definitely the async calls to the database. Will definitely refactor the code if I ever get back to working on this project.
